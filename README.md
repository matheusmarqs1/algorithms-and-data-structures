# Algorithms and Data Structures in Java

Welcome to my repository dedicated to studying **Algorithms and Data Structures** using the Java programming language. This project contains practical implementations, explanations, and examples of various classic algorithms and data structures covered in my university course.

## 📘 Course Topics

This repository is based on the official syllabus of my Algorithms and Data Structures course, which includes:

- **Sorting Algorithms**:  
  - Selection Sort  
  - Exchange-based Sorts (e.g., Bubble Sort)  
  - Distribution Sorts  
  - Insertion Sort  
  - Merge Sort  
  - Address Calculation Sorts

- **Searching Algorithms**:  
  - Sequential Search  
  - Binary Search  
  - Hashing  
  - Search Trees  
  - Binary Search Trees (BSTs)  
  - AVL Trees  
  - Patricia Trees  
  - B-Trees

- **File Organization**  
- **Time and Space Complexity Analysis**

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Strengthen my understanding of algorithmic logic and data structures  
- Practice clean and efficient Java coding  
- Share my learning journey and solutions with others

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Java 21 
- Eclipse IDE

## 📌 Notes

This repository is updated as I progress through the course and deepen my knowledge. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
